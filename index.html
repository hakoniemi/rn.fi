      <h2>React Native Applications</h2>
      <p>
        I've been working with React Native nearly ten years. I've been involved
        in many projects, both as a consultant and full-time employee.
      </p>
      <p>
        These hand-picked applications are the ones I'm most proud of. I can't
        point all the details due to limitations of ownership.
